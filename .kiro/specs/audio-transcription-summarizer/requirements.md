# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This application provides a simple solution for converting MP3 audio files into text transcriptions and generating concise summaries. The system accepts MP3 audio files as input, uses OpenAI's Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion, and applies OpenAI's GPT models for text summarization. This tool is designed for users who need to quickly extract key information from audio recordings, meetings, podcasts, or other spoken content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload an MP3 file to the application, so that I can get both a full transcription and a summary of the audio content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an MP3 file THEN the system SHALL accept the file and validate it is a valid MP3 format
2. WHEN an invalid file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject the file and display an error message
3. WHEN a valid MP3 file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process the file asynchronously and return a job ID
4. WHEN the file size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL reject the file and inform the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to convert my MP3 audio to text, so that I can read the full content of what was spoken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MP3 file is processed THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI Whisper API to generate a transcription
2. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL return the full text
3. WHEN transcription fails THEN the system SHALL return an error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to generate a summary of the transcribed text, so that I can quickly understand the key points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a summary using OpenAI GPT API
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL produce concise summaries that capture the main points
3. WHEN summarization fails THEN the system SHALL return the transcription without summary and indicate the error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to check the status of my processing job and retrieve results, so that I can get my transcription and summary when ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide a way to check processing status using the job ID
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL return both transcription and summary in JSON format
3. WHEN results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels for transcription and summary sections

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages
2. WHEN API services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN invalid job IDs are requested THEN the system SHALL return not found errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to process files asynchronously, so that I don't have to wait for long processing times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL process them in the background using a task queue
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL update job status appropriately
3. WHEN multiple files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently
